    "A dynamic and target-oriented person whose main interest lies in the world of programming. I love being more than just a developer and so I involve myself in every part of a products journey. I believe in owning what I choose to create. This lets me experience all aspects ranging from in-depth product research to planning the journey to reaching the product market fit. This drive to learn is what keeps me involved in both, the technical and management side of my work and allows me to engage in perhaps my greatest achievement; the ability to innovate.",
